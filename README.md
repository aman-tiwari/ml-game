This a repository of my various experiments in using generative machine learning with Unity3D.

Much thanks to Keijiro Takashi for his open-source [Pix2Pix implementation for Unity](https://github.com/keijiro/Pix2Pix).  My long-term goal is to figure out a way to share 
GPU memory between Unity and Python to enable zero-copy usage of machine learning algorithims without having to implement them using 
compute shaders (slower than CUDNN) or copying over CPU (needs 4 CPU<->GPU syncs). 

# Experiments so far
* Style-transfer using ZMQ ([tweet](https://twitter.com/aman_gif/status/980956169320763392))
* Pix2Pix run on raw camera output ([tweet](https://twitter.com/aman_gif/status/1061452857369608192))
* Pix2Pix run on raw camera output, clipped to object boundaries ([tweet](https://twitter.com/aman_gif/status/1061466608420433920))
* Triplanar shading with textures generated by pix2pix ([tweet](https://twitter.com/aman_gif/status/1061530710106873856))

# Next experiments
* Hexplanar shading & better tools for "authoring" the pix2pix textures
* Style-transfer without ZMQ copy, combining with pix2pix shading.
  * Lucid 3D style-transfer/3d deep-dream research
